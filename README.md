## General info
This project was to make the password generator work. 

## Technologies 
Project was created with
* Visual Studio Code

## Motivation
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password<br>
WHEN I click the button to generate a password<br>
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria<br>
WHEN prompted for password criteria<br>
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password<br>
WHEN prompted for the length of the password<br>
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters<br>
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password<br>
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters<br>
WHEN I answer each prompt<br>
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected<br>
WHEN all prompts are answered<br>
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria<br>
WHEN the password is generated<br>
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page<br>


## Usage
The user would click the button "Generate Password" and enter how many characters you would like to enter between 8 - 128. Then it will prompt if you would like Uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
